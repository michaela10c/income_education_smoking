Studies have also shown that socioeconomic indicators, such as household income and education, are related to smoking rates, which corresponds with a higher cancer rate, as middle-income countries are claimed to have more smokers (due to the lack of education and affordability of tobacco) as shown here, and more educated are claimed to be less likely to smoke as described in this article and this article. In this project, we are interested in corroborating these three claims by learning about the statistical relationships between household income, education level, smoking rates, and cancer rates. We work with four datasets (each representing different indicators): Educational Attainment by US State, Average/Median Income by US State, Average Smoking Rates by US State, and Cancer Rates by US State. All four datasets are collected from World Population Review, and each dataset is collected from a separate website. We will be inspecting each indicators as well as the relationships between each variable per US state. We plan to inspect each indicator separately by geography using heat maps. To explore the statistical relationships, we use EDA techniques such as scatter plot matrices and correlation plots between the different indicators. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic + Hypotheses 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic + Hypotheses The claim that smoking leads to cancer is well-documented. From the 1930s to 1950s, cigarette smoking was imbued in American culture. Media outlets such as billboard posters and TV commercials convinced people to smoke cigarettes, and a copious amount of Americans smoked. In 1964, the first major report smoking and health came from Surgeon General Luther Terry’s finding that revealed the harmful effects of smoking on lung cancer and heart disease. Years later in 1971, President Richard Nixon issued a ban on cigarette commercials on TV. Many anti-smoking compaigns followed, and cigarette smoking started declining steadily. Link to Reference. There has been studies that show that that cigarette smoking is linked with income and education levels. One such study that conveys this is shown in this video, which uses data from the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), and shows that low income countries cannot afford cigarettes and hence have low smoking rates; middle income countries have highest consumption of smoking since they do not have adequate education regulations; high income countries are better able to afford higher education, and have a lower smoking rate. Education also plays a vital role in terms of keeping people from smoking, as those that are well-educated are much less likely to be smokers, as shown by this study and this study. In this project, we not only corroborate the relationship between smoking and cancer in the 50 US states, we also want to corroborate the claims above by exploring the statistical relationships between average/median household income, education attainment rate (college/high school), smoking rates, and cancer rates per US state. How do different household income levels affect the proportion of smokers? How does education affect the proportion of smokers? Why do certain US regions have a higher proportion of smokers than others? Why do certain regions have a higher income or more education than others? This project also serves as a reminder for the audience to stay away from cigarette smoking at all times, regardless of background such as income level or education. 2.2 Data availability In this project, we are using four datasets: Educational Attainment by US State, Average/Median Income by US State, Average Smoking Rates by US State, and Cancer Rates by US State. All four datasets are collected from World Population Review, but collected via separate links. All four datasets are collected via web-scraping. The data on Educational Attainment uses two sources: US Census 2020 ACS 5-Year Survey and Educational Attainment in the United States: 2018. The data on Average/Median Income is collected from US Census 2020 ACS 5-Year Survey (Table S1901) and Per Capita Personal Income by State. The data on Smoking Rates is collected from American Health Rankings 2020. The data on Cancer Rates is collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the actual year the datasets were collected may be slightly different, World Population Review makes sure that the latest data is scraped from its corresponding primary sources, and there is not much difference when we analyze data within the same time frame. We chose to download these datasets mainly because they come from the same website, and is therefore very convenient to amalgamate together for analysis with very little preprocessing. This also allows modular design, as we can associate each dataset as an indicator to study. The following columns are present in all four datasets: fips (FIPS state code) state (US state name) densityMi (population density per square-mile) pop2023 (2023 population) pop2022 (2022 population) pop2020 (2020 population) pop2019 (2019 population) pop2010 (2010 population) growthRate (population growth rate since 2019) growth (population growth) growthSince2010 (population growth rate since 2010) The following additional columns are present in the Average/Median Income data: HouseholdIncome (average household income in $) HouseholdMedianIncome (median household income in $) The following additional columns are present in the Education Attainment data: PercentHighSchoolOrHigher (% of population that with high school diplomas) PercentBachelorsOrHigher (% of population that with college diplomas) The following additional columns are present in the Smoking Rates data: smokingRate (% of adults smoking) The following additional columns are present in the Cancer Rates data: ageAdjustedRate (# of cancer cases per 100K people) caseCount (absolute # of cancer cases) We use the state column, the HouseholdIncome column from the Income data, the PercentHighSchoolOrHigher and PercentBachelorsOrHigher columns from the Education Attainment data, the smokingRate column from the Smoking Rates data, and the ageAdjustedRate column from the Cancer Rates data. Population indicators such as densityMi (population density), pop2023, pop2022, pop2020, pop2019, pop2010, growthRate, growth, and growthSince2010, which are present in all four datasets, are irrelevant for our analysis. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Missing value analysis 3.3 Cleaning / transformation", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources In this project, we are using four datasets: Educational Attainment by US State, Average/Median Income by US State, Average Smoking Rates by US State, and Cancer Rates by US State. All four datasets are collected from World Population Review, but collected via separate links. All four datasets are available to download as CSV files. We chose to download these datasets mainly because they come from the same website, and is therefore very convenient to amalgamate together for analysis with very little preprocessing. This also allows modular design, as we can associate each dataset as an indicator to study. However, there is a major limitation to using these datasets in terms of originality of sources. All four datasets come from World Population Review, which is a third-party website that posts data from primary sources, rather than from original sources themselves. Moreoever, while the actual year the datasets were collected may be slightly different, World Population Review makes sure that the latest data is scraped from its corresponding primary sources, and there is not much difference when we analyze data within the same time frame. This project is meant to be used as a personal project, rather than any class or industry project that requires that all data collected be original. 3.2 Missing value analysis We first analyze whether there are any missing values in each of the datasets. We see that there are no missing data in either of the four datasets. Income data: Education data: Smoking data: Cancer data: 3.3 Cleaning / transformation We amalgamate the four datasets together, joining on the state column. For our analysis, we use the state column, the densityMicolumn, the HouseholdIncome column from the Income data, the PercentHighSchoolOrHigher and PercentBachelorsOrHigher columns from the Education Attainment data, the smokingRate column from the Smoking Rates data, and the ageAdjustedRate column from the Cancer Rates data. The ageAdjustedRate, smokingRate, HouseholdIncome, and densityMi columns are renamed to cancerCasesPer100K, smokingPercentage, HouseholdAverageIncome, and popDensity for clarity. Population indicators such as pop2023, pop2022, pop2020, pop2019, pop2010, growthRate, growth, and growthSince2010, which are present in all four datasets, are irrelevant and omitted from our analysis. The absolute populations are not normalized, and the population growth metrics are irrelevant for this analysis. We also removed District of Columbia since it is not an official state. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Data Exploration 4.2 Relationship between Variables", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Data Exploration Let’s take a look at each variable separately by each region: 4.1.1 Population density We can see that the New England region has a significantly higher population density than the rest of the United States, considering that the first American colonists settled in this region, and resources such as trade routes, education and employment opportunities are most abundant there. States that also have large population densities include California, Florida, New York, as well as midwest states. States such as Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, etc. are mostly wilderness and rural regions, and do not have a high population density. Income (Average and Median): We can see that the mean and median incomes are very similarly distributed, with the mean being substantially higher than the median likely due to outliers – there are exceptionally rich people in almost every state. We can see that the northeast regions has the highest income, mostly due to the abundance of economic resources, such as education, employment, and trade routes. We also see high hosuehold income in states like California and Washington, as they are home to employment opportunities especially the major tech industries (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.). States mostly dominated by working-class such as West Virginia and Mississippi, have the lowest mean and median income. 4.1.2 Education (percentage with college/high school degrees) We can see that the most educated areas in terms of college attainment are in the northeast, as well as Colorado. It is not a surprise that the northeast region has the highest proportion of college attainment, as it is the home to prestigious colleges such as Ivy League schools as well as the oldest universities of America. We see that Colorado also has a very high college attainment rate, as shown in this article, which is mostly because college is becoming more affordable in the state. We see that West Virginia has the lowest higher education rate, as much of the labor force is cheap and do not require a college degree as described here. For high school attainment, we see the largest states, California and Texas, has the lowest high school graduation rate, mostly due to income inequality issues link, link). Most of the US states have very similar high school graduation rates. 4.1.3 Smoking We can see that the smoking rates for West Virginia, Kentucky, and Louisiana are the highest. In prior heat maps, we’ve shown that West Virginia has one of the lowest household income and college education rates, as it is mostly dominated by working class. In fact, the 12 “Tobacco Nation” states (Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and West Virginia) all have a high smoking rate, as they share the similar challenges of low income, a paucity of infrastructure and health-care resources, as well as a lack of anti-tobacco policies according to this article. Utah has the lowest smoking rate, partly due to a large religious population. 4.1.4 Cancer We can see that South Dakota and Iowa have (reportedly) low cancer rates. South Dakota is one of the top states in terms of early diagnosis of cancer. It also seems strange that Iowa has a low cancer rate, as this article contradicts this argument. This might be an error in terms of the data points, since the data was reported via a third-party website. For the most part, however, most of the states have very similar cancer rates. Because there is so much variation in cancer causes, it is very difficult to analyze why each states have certain causes of cancer (https://www.jimmyfund.org/about-us/news-and-publications/announcements/which-u-s--states-have-the-highest-cancer-rates-/). 4.2 Relationship between Variables We see a very high negative correlation between the smoking rate and the household income (median and mean), smoking rate and college graduation rate, as well as a high positive correlation between income and college graduation rate. Evidently, states with more higher-income households can better afford higher education (such as college), and those that can attain higher education are much less likely to be smokers. This matches our prior hypothesis that the well-educated are much less likely to be smokers. Notice we emphasized higher education such as college, since we see that high school graduation rate does not correlate as strongly with income or smoking rates. This is most likely because there are high school districts in the United States that offer free-lunch or reduced-price lunch, where enrolling into high schools costs little to none. This emphasizes the importance of getting a college degree, as people with a college degree are not only less likely to smoke, they are also better prepared to get employed for the future. Earlier research also showed that low income countries cannot afford cigarettes and hence have low smoking rates; middle income countries have highest consumption of smoking since they do not have adequate education regulations; high income countries are better able to afford higher education, and have a lower smoking rate. However, when we do this analysis on the 50 US states, we get a direct positive correlation between income and smoking rates, and an even stronger positive correlation between income and college graduation rates. This is due to the earlier claim that higher income households are more likely to afford higher education, and those that attain higher education are less likely to become smokers. This is also an example of Simpson’s paradox, where a certain correlation between two variables across different countries does not imply that the same correlation will exist within a single country - it may have no correlation, or even an opposite correlation. In data science, it is a terrible practice to generalize one theory that holds across groups within a group. What is surprising is that the positive correlation between smoking rates and cancer rates is weaker than expected. This can most likely be attributed to the fact that cancer is not only cause by smoking, but also many other factors (e.g. obesity, age, alcoholism, etc.). Cancer cases can also be divided into multiple types of cancer, such as lung cancer, heart disease, colon cancer, etc. This, however, does not contradict the fact that smoking is a significant factor. If we have chosen a dataset for a specific type of cancer (e.g. lung cancer), the correlation would likely be much higher.

After looking at the data, we see that income, education (in particular, college education), and smoking rates are very closely correlated, as higher income states can better afford higher education, and states that have better higher education attainment rates have lower prevalence of smokers. This is consistent with the fact that states with higher average and median household income have a lower prevalence of smokers, and is not the same as earlier research which suggested that low income countries have lower rates of smoking (because of Simpson’s Paradox). Our analysis did not show strong correlation between smoking and cancer, mostly because of the variability of different types of cancers, as well as the causes of cancers; this does not mean that smoking is not a factor of cancer (it is still an important factor), but it is just one of many causes of certain types of cancer. 6.2 Limitations Our analysis is very general, and does not break down into subcategories; for instance, the Smoking dataset does not separate into different types of smoking (cigarettes, cigars, E-cigs, etc.); in addition, the Cancer data does not go into more detail about the specific types of cancer; moreover, neither the Smoking or Cancer data separates by gender or age group. Our project does not involve any historical data. It is also worth noting that we can use many more socioeconomic indicators other than household income and education to analyze with smoking and cancer. Moreoever, we would have to go to separate websites to add more indicators to analyze, which makes this project unscalable. As a disclaimer, this project is meant to be used as a personal project, rather than any class or industry project that requires that all data collected be original. 6.3 Future Work One thing that could improve our analysis is to find primary sources that have original data, rather than third-party websites that report data. In addition to income and education level, we could leverage using more socioeconomic indicators to analyze with smoking (e.g., employment). With a large amount of socioeconomic indicators, we could also leverage sources such as ESRI, rather than using one separate website for each indicator. 6.4 Lessons Learned In this project, we have learned how to amalgamate different datasets and use each dataset as a separate variable, inspect the each variable separately in each geographical region, and analyze the statistical relationships between variables and using plots to visualize them. We also learned that just because a group has a certain correlation with a variable does not mean that its subgroups will have the same correlation with that variable - it could either have no relationship or be reversed (Simpson’s Paradox). A variable can sometimes be too general to analyze - Cancer Rate can be split into multiple different types of cancer, and has a wide variability of causes other than smoking (e.g. obesity, alcoholism, age, etc.). More importantly, this project is used to send a reminder to the audience to stay away from cigarette smoking at all times regardless of background such as education or income. "],["extraneous-graphs.html", "Chapter 7 Extraneous graphs", " Chapter 7 Extraneous graphs These are some graphs we considered, but ultimately did not decide to have, since they do not best contribute to the overall story. While these graphs do show the distribution data of each variable, we are more interested in analyzing each region geographically with respect to each variable. ## [ ## { ## &quot;state&quot;: &quot;AK&quot;, ## &quot;value&quot;: 1.2974 ## }, ## { ## &quot;state&quot;: &quot;WY&quot;, ## &quot;value&quot;: 5.9821 ## }, ## { ## &quot;state&quot;: &quot;MT&quot;, ## &quot;value&quot;: 7.6448 ## }, ## { ## &quot;state&quot;: &quot;ND&quot;, ## &quot;value&quot;: 11.7541 ## }, ## { ## &quot;state&quot;: &quot;SD&quot;, ## &quot;value&quot;: 11.9826 ## } ## ] Population Density: Income (Average and Median): Education (percentage with high school or college degrees): Smoking: Cancer: Let’s look at the distribution of each of the indicators: Income (Average and Median): We can see that the mean and median have very similar distributions, with the mean being higher than the median (since we have a few outliers in each state that are extremely rich). Education (proportion with high school or college degrees): We see here way more people get their high school diplomas than college diplomas, since fewer people can afford to go to college compared to high school. The distributions themselves, however, do not look very similar to each other. We can plot two separate Cleveland dot plots for High School and College, taking the top 5 and bottom 5: Smoking: Cancer: We see that the Kentucky and West Virginia have the highest smoking and cancer rates. This is understandable, since we see that WV and KY are last and fourth-to-last in college education rates.
